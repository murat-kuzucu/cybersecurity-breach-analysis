# Cybersecurity Breach Analysis Project

This project analyzes cybersecurity breach data to identify patterns, trends, and key factors affecting financial losses and incident resolution times across different industries and regions.

## Project Overview

This analysis uses a comprehensive dataset of cybersecurity breaches from 2015-2024, examining:
- Financial impacts across industries
- Resolution times for different attack types
- Security vulnerability effectiveness 
- Attack source patterns
- Regional cybersecurity trends

## Research Question

"What are the most significant factors affecting financial losses and resolution times in cybersecurity breaches across different industries and regions?"

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Analysis of existing dataset containing global cybersecurity breach data
   - Supplementary survey questionnaire (design document included)

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns
   - Statistical analysis of financial impacts
   - Time-series analysis of breach trends
   - Correlation analysis between variables

3. **Visualization**:
   - Industry-specific financial impact charts
   - Attack type distribution visualizations
   - Resolution time comparisons
   - Security vulnerability effectiveness charts
   - Geographic distribution maps
