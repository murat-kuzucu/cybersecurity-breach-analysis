- Healthcare faced the highest proportion of Ransomware attacks
- Government entities experienced more SQL Injection attacks
- Education institutions were predominantly affected by Phishing attacks

These patterns highlight how attackers tailor their approaches based on industry-specific vulnerabilities and valuable assets.

### 3.3 Resolution Time Analysis

#### 3.3.1 Resolution Time by Attack Type

The analysis of incident resolution times revealed significant variations based on attack type:

- Ransomware attacks required the longest average resolution time
- DDoS attacks were typically resolved more quickly
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks showed the greatest variability in resolution times

These differences reflect the varying complexity of attack remediation, particularly with attacks like ransomware that may involve complex recovery processes.

#### 3.3.2 Resolution Time by Country

Resolution times also varied notably by country:

- Incidents in the UK and Germany were resolved more quickly on average
- Incidents in China and India typically required longer resolution times

These geographic differences may reflect variations in security resources, expertise, regulatory environments, and reporting requirements.

#### 3.3.3 Relationship Between Resolution Time and Financial Loss

A correlation analysis between resolution time and financial loss revealed:

- A moderate positive correlation (r = 0.62) between resolution time and financial loss
- This relationship was strongest for Ransomware and Man-in-the-Middle attacks
- The correlation weakened for incidents where AI-based detection was implemented

This finding underscores the importance of rapid incident detection and response in minimizing financial damages.

### 3.4 Security Vulnerability Analysis
